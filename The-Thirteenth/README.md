In this work, I designed a tic-tac-toe game using JavaScript, which has two game modes for two players and a computer game. It also includes scoring mode and announcing the winner. When three pieces of a player are placed in a row column or diameter, the player is declared the winner. The visual design of this game is done by HTML and CSS, and the logic of the game is done by JavaScript.
 The output is:
